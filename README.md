2. _Navigate to your desired directory in your command terminal and run "$ git clone https://github.com/ryan-spencer1220/dev-portfolio.git"_
3. _Should you wish to edit the code you cloned, you will need coding software. VS Code is an example of a free code editor, which can be downloaded at https://code.visualstudio.com/_.
4. _Once your coding software is installed, open the folder of the cloned repository, which will contain the HTML files, the bootstrap.css framework, any images, audio, as well separate individual stylesheets for each HTML file._
5. _To view the finished site locally, simply navigate to the folder/directory which you cloned the project, and open the index.html file in your browser._

**Downloading**

1. _In your browser, navigate to https://github.com/ryan-spencer1220/dev-portfolio, and click the green "Code" button, which will provide a drop down menu. Click on "Download ZIP" at the bottom of the menu, and save it to your desired location._
2. _Once downloaded, unzip and extract the files._
3. _Follow the steps above to view, edit, and open the files as needed._

**Build the Environment and Run the Project**

1. _You will need to run the command "npm install" in your terminal to download the appropriate node modules._
2. _You will then need to build the project using the command "npm run build"._
3. _Once built, you can open dist/index.html in your browser._
4. _To run a server view of the project, you can type the command "npm start" to witness and inspect any changes you wish to make in real time._

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
